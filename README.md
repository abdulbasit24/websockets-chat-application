# Real-time Chat Application

## Overview

This is a real-time chat application built using Java, Spring Boot, and WebSockets. The application includes user authentication and authorization using Spring Security and integrates with Apache Kafka for message queuing. The front-end is implemented with a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript UI.

## Features

- Real-time messaging using WebSockets
- User authentication and authorization
- Integration with Apache Kafka for message queuing
- Simple and responsive chat interface

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Programming language
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building the application
- **Spring Security**: For authentication and authorization
- **Spring WebSocket**: For real-time communication
- **Apache Kafka**: Message broker
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Front-end technologies

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

- Java 17 or later
- Apache Kafka (or RabbitMQ if you prefer)
- Maven (for building the project)

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chat-application.git
cd chat-application
```

### 2. Configure Kafka

Ensure that Apache Kafka is running locally. If you havenâ€™t installed Kafka, you can follow the [Apache Kafka Quickstart guide](https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart) for installation and setup.

### 3. Build the Project

Use Maven to build the project:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

### 4. Run the Application

You can run the Spring Boot application using Maven:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Alternatively, you can build the JAR file and run it:

```bash
mvn package
java -jar target/chat-application-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

### 5. Access the Application

Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to access the chat application.

## Application Structure

- **`src/main/java/com/example/chat/`**: Contains Java code for the application.
  - **`config/`**: Configuration classes for WebSocket, Security, and Kafka.
  - **`controller/`**: REST controllers for handling WebSocket messages.
  - **`model/`**: Data models used in the application.
  - **`service/`**: Service classes for business logic and Kafka integration.
  - **`ChatApplication.java`**: Main application class.
- **`src/main/resources/`**: Contains application configuration and static resources.
